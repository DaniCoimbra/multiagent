Multi-Agent Search in Pacman

The project involves implementing various search algorithms in Python to solve problems for Pacman in different maze environments. As in the classic version, this implemenation include ghosts and food, and the objective is to design agents that beat optimally the game.
Some algorithms implemented include: Minimax Search, Expectimax Search and Evaluation function design.

For specific details and instructions on how to complete each task, the code can be found in the "multiAgents.py" files provided in the GitHub repository.
